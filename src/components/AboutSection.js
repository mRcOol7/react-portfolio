Currently pursuing my academic journey, I thrive on challenging projects that allow me to explore innovative solutions and technologies.</p>
            
            <p>➤ Outside the academic realm, I channel my creativity into designing Snapchat lenses. This venture not only allows me to express my artistic side but also sharpens my skills in augmented reality development. I am constantly exploring new ways to bring engaging and delightful experiences to users through my lens creations.</p>
            
            <p>➤ Driven by a deep interest in cybersecurity, I am an enthusiastic ethical hacker. I enjoy the continuous process of learning and refining my abilities to address cybersecurity challenges. Exploring vulnerabilities and securing systems is not just a profession for me but a thrilling journey towards creating a safer digital environment.</p>
            
            <p>➤ Beyond the world of technology, I am a sports enthusiast with a profound love for cricket, football, tennis, F1 racing, and kabaddi. Sports not only provide me with a recreational outlet but also teach me valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p>
